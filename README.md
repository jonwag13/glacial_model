# glacial_model
Here I use python to both model and visualize glacier dynamics based on physics-based relations.  Although this was part of an academic-based project, I have since continued to work on the visualization as a personal project.  My goal is to create a GUI which allows the models to be interactive and serve as an educational tool for STEM youth.
